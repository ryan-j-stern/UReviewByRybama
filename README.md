# UReview By Rybama
UReview is a movie review website, where users can sign up / login and leave their own personal reviews for the public to see. Users can also add movies to their own personal "Watched List" and "Wish List" in order to document which movies they have already seen, and which movies they would like to see next.

Movies can be searched for in the search bar, along with our home page displaying the list of movies that are the most popular of all-time. Once users click into a movie, the movies poster, title, tagline, and description appear at the top of the screen, with all of the users reviews appearing at the bottom.

Users can go to their profile to see what reviews they have given, as well as a list of their personal "Wish List" and "Watched List".
